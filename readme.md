This project aims to create an intelligent system that can complete an overarching goal through the use of agents with different abilities. The system revolves around an event loop, where agents interact with each other and the environment to complete the goal. The project is built using a modular approach, with various agents representing different capabilities, and a central agent that selects the most appropriate action based on the current log.
