				 Goal: Write a rust project that calculates all of the fibianacci numbers up to 1000 and prints them out. Then renders a fractal using that information.



The lead_team agent should be invoked first to define the project requirements and create tickets for the developers. Then the write_tests agent should be run every time the developer produces code to ensure quality control. The write_code agent will then be responsible for implementing the code based on the tickets provided by the lead_team agent. Finally, the choose_action agent should be invoked to decide which agent to invoke next based on the current log of actions taken. This will ensure that the project is implemented efficiently and effectively with attention given to quality control and overall project requirements.

Based on the given agents, a possible action to take is to create a workflow that starts with the write_architecture agent defining the project's high-level requirements and the programming language to be used. Then, the lead_team agent takes these requirements and creates tickets for the developers to work on. 

The choose_action agent selects the most appropriate agents to execute, depending on the current state of the project. If the developers produce new code, the write_tests agent will automatically test it. When the developers complete a ticket, the write_code agent will write the code that meets the requirements. The agents work in a continuous loop, responding to changes in the codebase and ensuring that the project stays on track.

It depends on the current state of the project and the needs of the team. If there are already tickets assigned to the developer, the write_code agent can start working on those. Otherwise, they can communicate with the lead_team agent to determine which tickets need to be created and assign themselves to work on those. The write_code agent should also continually check the test cases written by the write_tests agent to ensure that their code is functioning correctly.

It depends on where in the software development process we are. If we are in the planning stage, the "write_architecture" agent should be invoked first to determine high-level requirements and programming language. Then, the "lead_team" agent can be invoked to assign tickets and begin development.

If we are further along in the process and have tickets assigned to developers, the "write_tests" and "write_code" agents can be invoked to ensure the code being written is thoroughly tested and meets the requirements established by the team lead. 

The "choose_action" agent should constantly be running to determine which agent to invoke based on the current state of the project.

It depends on the specific needs of the project and the actions taken so far in the development process. However, the general steps that this agent may take include:

1. Reviewing the project requirements and any tickets assigned by the team lead.
2. Researching and selecting appropriate programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
3. Designing and implementing the necessary code modules to meet the requirements.
4. Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the code.
5. Refactoring the code as needed to optimize performance, readability, and maintainability.
6. Documenting the code and providing clear instructions for future maintenance and enhancements.

Throughout the process, the agent should also collaborate with other agents, such as the write_tests and lead_team agents, to ensure the overall success and quality of the project.
