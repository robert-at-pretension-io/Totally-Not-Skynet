	[assistant]:[Sure, here's an example of how to use Python and Flask to create a web application that displays pictures of cats:

First, install Flask via pip:

```
pip install Flask
```

Next, create a new Python file, for example called `app.py`, and add the following code:

[code:python]
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a list of cat images
cat_images = [
  'https://placekitten.com/400/400',
  'https://placekitten.com/401/401',
  'https://placekitten.com/402/402',
  'https://placekitten.com/403/403',
]

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', cat_images=cat_images)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
[/code]

This code imports the Flask module, creates a new Flask web application instance, and defines a list of cat images (using the placeholder images from placekitten.com). The `@app.route` decorator creates a route for the homepage ("/") of the web application that will render a template called "index.html" using the `render_template` function. This function takes the template name and any additional data as keyword arguments, which in this case includes the list of cat images. Finally, the code starts the Flask application when the script is executed.

Create a new file called `templates/index.html` and add the following HTML code:

[code:html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Cat Pictures</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Cat Pictures</h1>

    {% for image in cat_images %}
      <img src="{{ image }}" alt="Cat picture" width="400" height="400">
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
[/code]

This code defines a simple HTML page with a header and a loop that iterates over the `cat_images` list and creates an `<img>` element for each one. The `{{ image }}` variable is a Jinja2 template variable that will be replaced with the actual image URL when the template is rendered.

To run the application, go into the directory where `app.py` and `templates/index.html` are saved and run the command:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask application and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`. It should display a page with the header "Cat Pictures" and four placeholder images of cats. Note that in a real-world application, you would have more than placeholder images/code.]
