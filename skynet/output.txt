				 Goal: Make a website that displays pictures of cats.

Prompt:
Determine which action to take in order to make progress on the stated goal. If the log is nearly empty, the best action will be to invoke the architect to write project requirements. You will be provided the goal on the next line and then a sequence of action : description pairs. Look over the list of action : description pairs and choose the action that will make progress on the task. If the most recent (entries on the bottom) log entry indicates the developer is struggling, invoke the architect. If there is enough information to start writing code, invoke the developer. Respond with the exact action name (the string that preceeds the colon).Goal: Make a website that displays pictures of cats.
write_tests : This agent will write code that tests the most immediate code in the log. This agent should be run any time the developer produces code.
write_architecture : This agent will give the developer guidance on how to move forward if they are stuck.
choose_action : This agent chooses which agent to invoke given the current log of actions taken
developer : This agent will write code that fulfills the requirements of the project.

Prompt:

[write_architecture]:[This agent will give the developer guidance on how to move forward if they are stuck.]
Given the project goal, please come up with a list of functions, objects and types that must be implemented to complete the project. You may specify which programming language to use to implement the software if you think there is one that will be easiest to implement them in. If the log already contains code, give guidance on what other functions, objects, types or patterns remain to be implmented.

OpenAI response:

To implement the functionality of the write_architecture agent, we will need to design and implement the following:

1. A Function to Process User Input: This function will take input from the developer and process it to extract relevant information about the project. The function will need to be able to extract project goals, requirements, constraints, and dependencies.

2. A Data Structure to Store Project Information: We will need to define a data structure to store project related information including goals, requirements, constraints, dependencies, and other relevant data. For example, we may use a dictionary or JSON object to store and organize project information.

3. A Pattern for Analyzing Code: To guide the developer when they are stuck in any part of the project implementation, we will need to analyze the code and identify issues or gaps in implementation. We can use a pattern based analysis to identify common issues that developers may face during the implementation of the project. This can include issues related to syntax, logic, data flow, or user interface design.

4. A Pattern for Recommending Solutions: Based on the analysis, we will need to recommend solutions that the developer can use to move forward with the project implementation. This can include code snippets, libraries, or tool recommendations that might be useful for the developer to implement the project.

To implement the write_architecture agent, we can use any programming language that can interact with text input, data structures, and provide pattern analysis and recommendation functionality. Python, JavaScript, and Java are some examples of programming languages that can be used for this purpose. 

As the log already contains the project goal, we can start implementing the function to process user input and a data structure to store it. Once the project information is stored, we can use pattern-based analysis methods to identify the gaps in the implementation and provide recommendations to the developer.
