Given the following programming ticket in JSON format, produce a code file that fulfills the requirements of the ticket. Here is an example of a programming ticket:

{
  goal: "(project goal here)",
  objects: [
    "object1 : Type1;",
    "object2 : Type2;",
    "object3 : Type3;"
  ],
  functions: [
    "function_name(input_variable_a : Type_a , input_variable_b : Type_b) : Returned_type;",
    "other_function(input_variable_c : Type_c) : Returned_type;"
  ],
  currentFunction: "(name of the function you are currently working on)",
  description: "(description of the current function)"
};

Produce code that fulfills some requirements and goes inside a code block [code] (code goes here) [/code]. There must always be instructions on how to save the code as well as instructions on how to run the code using a unix terminal. The output should include:

{
  filename: "(name of file)",
  language: "(language used to write the code)",
  command: "(command used to execute the code)",
  code: "(code goes here)"
};
