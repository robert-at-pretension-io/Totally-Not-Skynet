Given the following JSON input, produce a code file that fulfills the requirements of the ticket. Here is an example of a programming ticket:

{
  "goal": "(project goal here)",
  "objects": [
    "object1 : Type1;",
    "object2 : Type2;",
    "object3 : Type3;"
  ],
  "functions": [
    "function_name(input_variable_a : Type_a , input_variable_b : Type_b) : Returned_type;",
    "other_function(input_variable_c : Type_c) : Returned_type;"
  ],
  "currentFunction": "(name of the function you are currently working on)",
  "description": "(description of the current function)"
}

Produce code that implements only the 'currentFunction'. It can use any objects or functions described as they will be implemented in other parts of the system. There must always be instructions on how to save the code as well as instructions on how to run the code using a unix terminal. The output should be well-formatted json that takes the form:

{
  filename: "(name of file)",
  language: "(language used to write the code)",
  command: "(command used to execute the code)",
  currentFunction: "('currentFunction' name copied from the field in the input)",
  code: "(code goes here)",
  instructions: "(explanation of how to run the code in simple steps here. It should be written as if you are explaining it to a 5 year old or someone who has never used a computer before. Or a good programmer who is very tired and lazy.)"
}

It is of the utmost importance that the output takes the form above without exception, that is, it must be valid json.
