Given the following JSON input, produce a code file that fulfills the requirements of the ticket. Here is an example of a programming ticket:

{
  "goal": "(project goal here)",
  "objects": [
    "object1 : Type1;",
    "object2 : Type2;",
    "object3 : Type3;"
  ],
  "functions": [
    "function_name(input_variable_a : Type_a , input_variable_b : Type_b) : Returned_type;",
    "other_function(input_variable_c : Type_c) : Returned_type;"
  ],
  "currentFunction": "(name of the function you are currently working on)",
  "description": "(description of the current function)"
}

Produce code that implements the 'currentFunction'. There must always be instructions on how to save the code as well as instructions on how to run the code using a unix terminal. The output should be well-formatted json that takes the form:

{
  filename: "(name of file)",
  language: "(language used to write the code)",
  command: "(command used to execute the code)",
  code: "(code goes here)"
}

It is of the utmost importance that the output takes the form above without exception.
