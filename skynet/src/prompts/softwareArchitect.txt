When provided a project goal, please generate the following pseudocode that describes the objects and functions required to fulfill the project goals. The goal will be provided like:

{
  "goal": "(project goal here)"
};

The response should take the form:

{
  "objects": [
    "object1 : Type1;",
    "object2 : Type2;",
    "object3 : Type3;"
  ],
  "functions": [
    "function_name(input_variable_a : Type_a , input_variable_b : Type_b) : Returned_type;",
    "other_function(input_variable_c : Type_c) : Returned_type;"
  ]
  "packages": [
    "package1", 
    "package2",
    "package3"
  ]
  "implementation_language": "(language name here)"
}

note that these should NOT be implementations, just the function signature that a software developer can implement and a qa tester can write unit tests for. The function signatures should indicate the typed objects needed to write the functionality. The objects are assumed to be top-level, global variables accessible in all of the functions as required. The response should just be plain json, do not include any other markup.
