<h1>Node Graph System: Key Concepts and Purpose</h1>

<p>
The Node Graph System, at its core, is a way to represent and manage complex workflows. In this system, a "node" is a distinct unit of operation or process, while "edges" or connections define the relationships and paths of execution between nodes.
</p>

<p>
The Node Graph System has the following key concepts:
</p>

<h2>1. Nodes:</h2>
<p>
Nodes are the fundamental units of the system. Each node represents a single task or process that the system can perform. For example, a node could represent a mathematical operation, a data retrieval process, or a user interaction event.
</p>

<h2>2. Edges:</h2>
<p>
Edges connect nodes together to create a "graph" structure. An edge from node A to node B indicates that the operation represented by node B can only occur after the operation represented by node A is completed. The edge thus illustrates the sequence and dependency of operations.
</p>

<h2>3. Graph:</h2>
<p>
The Graph represents the entire workflow as a system of interconnected nodes. The graph structure allows the system to visualize and handle complex, interconnected workflows effectively.
</p>

<h1>Why does the Node Graph System exist?</h1>

<p>
The Node Graph System exists to provide a powerful, flexible, and visual way to manage complex processes and workflows. With it, you can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Represent complex workflows visually and intuitively</li>
    <li>Handle workflows that have concurrent processes or tasks</li>
    <li>Modify workflows easily by adding, removing, or re-connecting nodes</li>
    <li>Build and manage workflows that have complex dependencies and sequence requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, the Node Graph System allows for the handling of complex workflows in a way that is scalable, manageable, and easy to understand.
